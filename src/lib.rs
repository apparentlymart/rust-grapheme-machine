//! An implementation of the Grapheme Cluster portion of
//! [UAX #29: Unicode Text Segmentation](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/)
//! that prioritizes streaming-friendliness and simplicity.
//!
//! This library implements the segmentation algorithm as of Unicode 16.0.0,
//! using the character database tables from that release.
//!
//! [`GraphemeMachine`] is the main type in this library. Construct an object
//! of that type and then feed it characters from a stream one at a time, and
//! in return it will tell you for each new character whether it should be
//! treated as an extension of the current grapheme cluster or the beginning
//! of a new one. That's all there is to it!
//!
//! ---
//!
//! The canonical Rust library for UAX #29 is
//! [`unicode_segmentation`](https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/),
//! and so that's actually probably what you should use in most cases. This
//! library has the following main distinctions (as of
//! `unicode_segmentation` v1.12.0):
//!
//! - The primary entry point for grapheme clusters in `unicode_segmentation`
//!   is [`Graphemes`](https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/struct.Graphemes.html),
//!   which expects the entire text to be in memory as a single buffer.
//!
//!   The library also offers [`GraphemeCursor`](https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/struct.GraphemeCursor.html)
//!   for working with non-contiguous buffers, but it has a rather challenging
//!   API and is difficult to use in a _completely_ streaming manner, with
//!   the caller required to sometimes provide earlier context to help it make
//!   a decision.
//!
//!   By contrast, [`GraphemeMachine`] in this library is a finite state machine
//!   that is advanced one character at a time, with no requirement for the
//!   caller to do any buffering at all. Of course in practice it's likely that
//!   a normal caller will need to at least buffer the current grapheme cluster
//!   so it can be used once finally split, but how to manage that is left
//!   entirely up to the caller.
//!
//!   For example, a caller could decide that it only cares about grapheme
//!   clusters up to some reasonable maximum length, after which it will
//!   just assume malicious or corrupt input and use the Unicode replacement
//!   character instead. The [`GraphemeMachine`] can still allow that caller
//!   to find the end of that overlong grapheme cluster and begin consuming
//!   the next one even though the caller is no longer including any new
//!   characters into its buffer.
//!
//! - `unicode_segmentation` finds the relevant Unicode character properties
//!   for incoming characters using binary search over its internal tables,
//!   after converting the character into a Rust [`char`] value.
//!
//!   [`GraphemeMachine`] instead prefers to work with UTF-8 encoded characters
//!   as represented by [`u8char`], which can be more cheaply extracted from
//!   and appended to Rust strings. The character property lookup is done using
//!   a trie based on the UTF-8 byte sequence, and so is potentially faster
//!   when you're chomping UTF-8 sequences from a `str` buffer one at a time.
//!
//!   (That's not necessarily true, though. Measure it yourself with the text
//!   you want to segment if performance is important to you!)
//!
//! - Although [`GraphemeMachine`] can work with [`char`] and [`u8char`] values
//!   representing specific characters, the segmentation algorithm is actually
//!   defined in terms of groups of characters that share similar properties.
//!
//!   This library exposes those categories as part of its public API using
//!   [`CharProperties`], [`GCBProperty`], and [`InCBProperty`], and so it
//!   could be useful purely as a character property lookup library even
//!   if you don't use [`GraphemeMachine`], or you could even choose to use
//!   your own tailored character property tables and pass [`CharProperties`]
//!   values directly to a [`GraphemeMachine`] object.
//!
//! Unless you have a good reason to prefer this library though, it's probably
//! better to use
//! [`unicode_segmentation`](https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/)
//! because it's widely-used in the Rust community, well-maintained by an
//! established team (whereas _this_ library has only a single,
//! easily-distracted author), and probably not subject to the important caveat
//! described in the following section.
//!
//! # An important caveat
//!
//! The author originally wrote the code and lookup tables in this library
//! internally within another project, and then proceeded to copy it into
//! several other projects that needed grapheme cluster segmentation. This
//! library is the result of finally getting around to separating it out into
//! a separate unit for release.
//!
//! Unfortunately the code that generated the trie used for character property
//! lookup seems to be missing, and so this library will probably be tethered
//! to Unicode 16.0.0 indefinitely unless the author gets somehow inspired
//! to recreate that generation program. ðŸ˜– If staying up-to-date with new
//! Unicode versions is important to you then you should probably use
//! [`unicode_segmentation`](https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/)
//! instead.
//!
//! It would in principle be possible to use a property lookup table maintained
//! outside of this crate and then produce [`CharProperties`] values to pass
//! into a [`GraphemeMachine`] without using this library's lookup tables at
//! all, though I expect few would be motivated to do that.
